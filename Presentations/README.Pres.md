#  Portland Data Science Group (PDSG) Presentations

## Machine Learning Introduction

Abstract: This PDSG workshop introduces basic concepts on machine learning. The course covers fundamentals and does not require attendees to
have a background in statistics or software programming. Concepts cover are Supervised and Unsupervised Learning, Decision Trees, Pruning,
Ensemble Trees, Linear Regressions, Loss Functions, K-means, dataset preparation.

The purpose of this course is to provide sufficient exposure to the attendees to aid in a general understanding and determination if one wants to continue to pursue learning machine learning as a skill.


## Tensor Flow Introduction

Abstract: This PDSG workshop introduces basic concepts on TensorFlow. The course covers fundamentals and does not require attendees to have
a background in statistics, while some basic programming is preferred. Concepts covered are Vectors/Matrices/Vectors, Design&Run, Constants, Operations, Placeholders, Bindings, Operators, Loss Function and Training.

The purpose of this course is to provide sufficient exposure to the attendees to aid in a general understanding and determination if one wants to continue to pursue learning TensorFlow as a skill.

## Dynamic Programming

Abstract: This PDSG workshop introduces basic concepts on dynamic programming. The course compares dynamic
programming to traditional programming and walks attendees through examples to demonstrate
both the difference and the concept. The course does require attendees to have basic software programming
knowledge and understanding of the breadth first search algorithm, which is used in the examples.

## Handling Narrative Fields in Datasets for Classification

Abstract: It is common for government and public datasets to include narrative fields, such as inspection reports, incident reporting, surveys, 911 calls, fire response, etc. In addition to categorical fields, such as datetime, location, demographics, these datasets tend to include a narrative description (e.g., what happened).  It is typically in the narrative field that the most interesting data resides for the purpose of classifying. The problem, is that since the narrative is human interpreted and entered, each entry may be unique and if we use the whole entry as a single value, one will end up with an overfitted model that works only on the training data.

In this presentation, I will cover how natural language processing techniques are used to convert narrative fields into categorical data.
